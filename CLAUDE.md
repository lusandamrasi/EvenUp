# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the EvenUp project - a newly initialized repository with minimal structure. The codebase currently contains only a basic README.md file and git repository setup.

## Current State

- Repository is in its initial state with only a README.md file
- No package.json, build scripts, or source code structure exists yet
- No specific technology stack has been established
- Clean git repository with initial commit

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the development environment and toolchain will need to be established based on the project requirements and technology choices.

## Architecture

The project architecture is not yet defined. Future development should establish:
- Technology stack and framework choices
- Project structure and organization
- Build and deployment processes
- Testing strategies

## Notes for Future Development

- This is a greenfield project ready for initial setup
- Technology stack decisions should be made based on project requirements
- Standard development practices should be established as the project grows
